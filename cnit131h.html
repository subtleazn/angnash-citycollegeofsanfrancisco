                <h3>First Verse</h3>
                <p>
                Silent love is calling faith<br>
                To shatter me through your hallways<br>
                Into echoes you can feel<br>
                And rehearse the way you heal<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Make them dance<br>
                Just like you<br>
                'Cause you make me move<br>
                Yeah, you always make me go<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                I'll run away with your footsteps<br>
                I'll build a city that dreams for two<br>
                And if you lose yourself<br>
                I will find you<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                High on words<br>
                We almost used<br>
                We're fireworks with a wet fuse<br>
                Flying planes with paper wheels<br>
                To the same Achilles heels<br>
               </p>
               <p>
                Make them dance<br>
                Just like you<br>
                'Cause you make me move<br>
                Yeah you always make me go<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                I'll run away with your footsteps<br>
                I'll build a city that dreams for two<br>
                And if you lose yourself<br>
                I will find you<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Yeah you always make me go...

                    (Go go go go, turn it up turn it up)<br>
                    Turn up your night<br>
                    I will find you<br>
                   </p>

                    'Cause you make me move<br>
                    Yeah, you always make me go
